* Write a status module that exports a variable that can be sent from
  each worker to a status poller endpoint.  Variable could be JSON or
  some other format, including counts of requests served, connections,
  worker and parent PID, hostname, configuration file, etc - enough so
  that an application that receives this information from many nginx
  instances can aggregate the data and provide some sort of visual
  representation of global nginx (instance and worker) status.

* Write the web application that would receive this information and 
  render it.

* Write an example configuration module that polls an endpoint for
  updates to the worker configuration.  An example update might enable
  or disable individual upstream servers.
